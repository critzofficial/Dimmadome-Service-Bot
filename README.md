Hello there! Welcome to **Dimmadome Service Bot**'s GitHub repository! Inside of this little ReadMe file, I will be explaining a few facts considering the bot and me, the creator.

Firstly, I want to say that you should look at the commands *before* inviting my bot. Some commands might not be how you want them to be. Even if it's a tiny thing, I respect it and leave it fully up to you to invite the bot...or not.

Now, about the permissions my bot (currently) needs:

**Kick/Ban Members** - The bot also is in power of kicking or banning users in various ways. Many of them are based off of filters, but there are direct kick and ban commands at hand too. Simply use *DD!kick* or *DD!ban* to make the job easier. If the bot lacks the permissions to do so, it will be aborted.

**Manage Channels** - The bot will require permission to manage channels for the channel parent command.

**Send/Manage Messages** - Some commands instantly delete the user's message once a special command is recognized. This is mostly used for owner/admin commands. Please make sure to check this. It will do no harm. Disabling this will also render the *DD!purge* command useless.

***About the bot***

The bot was made at first to be a fun little script for private servers of my friends, but has managed to climb the ladder to an official bot...more or less. The bot is capable of many commands that are expected to be stable. In case of instability, it is recommended to refrain from using the command and contacting me. I will fix it!

***About me***

About me, there is nothing much to say. Your everyday Discord user, just with a few coding "gods" to ask anything as well as some coding knowledge myself.

If you want to invite the bot, please use this link provided ( https://discordbots.org/bot/269533424916627457 ) to look at it's prefix, vote for it and finally add it into your own server. Good day!
